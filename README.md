# Happiness-And-Coffee
cups of coffee people have by countries and how coffee drinking correlates with happiness!

## Motivation: 
I love coffee. Drinking coffee has become my everyday ritual. Somedays, I am guilty of overindulging having more than 3 cups of coffee a day! However, it still amazes me how I never had drunk a cup of coffee before moving to the States 6 years ago. 

I did a quick search to check in which countries people drink the most coffee. All the viz and projects  on coffee consumption available online used the **“thousand 60 kgs bags”** unit.  I had difficulty to fathom how much are 60kgs bags are like because I had not seen that huge amount of coffee with my own eyes.  This prompted me to do this project where I explored which part of the world where coffee is popular. 

***Interesting Findings:***

- United States and Brazil, the top consumer of coffee, consuming **~1.64 trillion and 1.32 trillion** cups of coffee a year, respectively.
- Top 5 coffee consumed per capita countries: Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark ~6.0, ~2.9, ~2.4 and ~2.2 cups of coffee a day per capita, respectively.
- The median age for people is 40.7 where coffee is a popular drink
- ~ 85% population lives in urban areas in countries where coffee is a popular drink
- Coffee consumption correlates with happiness score (0.65)

## Build with:
SQL, Python Pandas, Seaborn, Tableu

## Data Cleaning and Preparation : 
In this project, I gathered Data from [ICO](https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp?section=Statistics) (International Coffee Organization),  [World Population data](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) and [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/archive/). 

## Coffee Consumption and population data

(*cleaned with SQL and Pandas*)

ICO has two coffee consumption datasets, domestic consumption and consumption data for importing countries. 

The following data cleaning actions has been performed with sql for the analysis.
